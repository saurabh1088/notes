#  React

react-dom for web apps and react-native for native mobile apps

React lets one build user interfaces out of individual components. One can also
create their own components and then use those to create screens, views, apps.



## Components

A React app is made from *components*. A *Component* is something which has its
own logic and appearance, it can be a very small and simple like a button, or can
be more complex like a full page.

React components are basically JavaScript functions. These functions are expected
to return a markup.

Once a component is declared, it can be used and nested in other components.

React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags 
must be lowercase. 

CSS class is specified with *className*, which works the same way as the HTML 
*class* attribute.

```
<img className="cssClassName" />

/* In CSS File */
.cssClassName {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```
