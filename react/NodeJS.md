#  Node.js


Node.js is an 
- asynchronous 
- event-driven 
- open-source
- cross-platform
JavaScript runtime environment allowing one to execute JavaScript code server-side.

Node.js is built on V8 JavaScript runtime engine.
Node.js enables the execution of JavaScript on the server, outside the context 
of a web browser.

Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications which can handle multiple
connections concurrently. Each connection will fire a callback and if no work is 
to be done then Node.js will sleep.
