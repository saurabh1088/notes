#  ReactNative

React Native is an open-source Framework which was developed by FaceBook. React Native enables one to build mobile 
applications using JavaScript and React. Aim here is to create cross-platform applications which can run both on iOS and 
Android platforms sharing a huge chunk of codebase.

Code is written in JavaScript and further rendered with native code.

React Native provides native components which map directly to target platform's native ones.

Similar to concept of views in iOS and Android, React Native also has views as the basic building blocks of user interface.
Everything seen on the UI boils down to a view.

React Native comes with some *Core Components* which are ready to use components for builiding UI. One can also build custom
native components.
