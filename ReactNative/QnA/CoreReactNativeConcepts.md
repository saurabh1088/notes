#  Core React Native Concepts


## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è1. Explain the different lifecycle methods in React Native and when they are used.
- React Native components follow a lifecycle that mirrors React components since React Native is built on React.
    - TODO: Check the React lifecycle methods.
- Understanding these lifecycle methods helps manage state, handle events, and perform side effects in an app.
- A component‚Äôs life cycle in React Native can be divided into 4 phases
    - Mounting
    - Updating
    - Unmounting
    - Error Handling

### 1.1 Mounting
- In this phase, component instance is created and inserted into the DOM(or the native UI for React Native).
- Key methods in mounting phase
    - `constructor()`
        - First method which gets called in the lifecycle of react native component.
        - Used to initialise the component with initial state.
        - Called before the component is mounted.
        - Commonly used for initializing the state or binding methods.
        - One should avoid API calls here.
    - `static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState)`
        - Invoked before rendering when new props or state are received.
        - Returns an object to update state or null to update nothing.
        - Rarely used instead `useEffect` or similar hooks in functional components are preferred approaches.
    - `render()`
        - Only required method in react component.
        - It tells what to display on the screen.
        - Returns the JSX to be displayed.
        - It's a pure function, means it doesn't modify state.
        - Returns the same result each time it is invoked.
        - Does not directly interact with the browser.
    - `componentDidMount()`
        - Called immediately after the component is mounted.
        - Ideal for API calls, setting up subscriptions, state update, or initial DOM/native operations.
        - This will refresh the UI of our mobile screen.

### 1.2 Updating
- In updating phase, a react component is said to be born and it start growing by receiving new updates.
- This phase occurs when a component's state or props change.
- Key methods in updating phase
    - `static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState)`
        - Same as in the mounting phase, also called during updates.
        - This method gets called whenever any changes occurred in state or props.
    - `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`
        - Determines whether the component should re-render.
        - Returns true (default) or false.
        - Useful for optimizing performance.
        - Doesn't gets called on initial render or when forceUpdate is used.
        - To stop re-rendering on changing state or props, one should return false.
    - `render()`
        - Same as in the mounting phase.
        - Whenever there is any change in the state or props then render methods gets called again.
    - `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`
        - Captures information from the DOM before changes are applied.
        - Returns a value passed to componentDidUpdate.
    - `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`
        - Called after the component has been updated.
        - Ideal for performing DOM operations or further updates based on changes.

### 1.3 Unmounting
- In this phase, a react component gets removed from actual DOM.
- Key methods in unmounting phase
    - `componentWillUnmount()`
        - Gets invoked when component is removed from the DOM.
        - Called immediately before a component is unmounted.
        - Ideal for cleanup tasks like canceling API calls, removing event listeners, or invalidating timers.

### 1.4 Error Handling
- It is called when any error occurs while rendering the component.
- Key methods in error handling phase
    - `static getDerivedStateFromError()`
        - It is called whenever any error occurred while rendering.
        - It receives the error as a parameter and returns the value to update the state.
    - `componentDidCatch()`
        - Invoked when any error is thrown by descendant component.
        - Receives error and info objects.
        - Info object received has information about which component threw that error.


## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è2. Describe JSX syntax and its benefits in React Native.
- JSX(JavaScript XML) is an extension syntax for JavaScript, popularized by React and used in React Native development.
- It allows one to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to describe UI structures.
- JSX produces React elements.

### 2.1 Why JSX is required?
- First thing, Reach DOES NOT require using JSX.
- React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic.
- So instead of trying to separate technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns
with loosely coupled units called components that contain both.
- So most people will find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code.
-  It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

### 2.2 Benefits of JSX in React Native

#### 2.2.1 Clarity and Readability:
- JSX makes the structure of UI components more intuitive and similar to HTML, which is familiar to many developers.
- This visual similarity aids in understanding the component hierarchy at a glance.
#### 2.2.2 Performance:
- The compilation of JSX into JavaScript function calls allows React to optimize rendering by minimizing DOM manipulation.
- In React Native, this translates to more efficient updates to the native view tree.
#### 2.2.3 Type Safety with TypeScript:
- When used with TypeScript, JSX can provide type-checking for props, which helps catch errors during development rather
than at runtime.
#### 2.2.4 Modularity and Reusability:
- JSX encourages component-based architecture where each piece of the UI can be a modular, reusable component.
- This modular approach is central to React Native's philosophy.
#### 2.2.5 Integration with JavaScript:
- By blending HTML-like syntax with JavaScript, one can handle logic and UI in one place, reducing the separation between
behavior and appearance.
- This integration is particularly beneficial in mobile development where one might need to respond to device-specific
events or use native APIs.
#### 2.2.6 Easier Debugging:
- Since JSX is transformed into JavaScript calls, one can use standard JavaScript debugging tools, making it easier to
step through the code where UI and logic meet.
#### 2.2.7 Better Developer Experience:
- Many IDEs and text editors support JSX with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and live previews, which enhances
development speed and reduces errors.
#### 2.2.8 Expressive and Concise:
- JSX allows developers to express UI in a way that's both descriptive and concise, reducing the cognitive load of mapping
back and forth between UI design and implementation.
#### 2.2.9 Encourages Declarative Programming:
- JSX fosters a declarative style where you describe what the UI should look like given certain props, rather than
imperatively manipulating the UI.


## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è3. Explain the core concepts of Redux: state, actions, reducers, and store. How do you implement Redux in a React Native app‚ùì

### 3.1 What is Redux?
- Redux is a JavaScript library for predictable and maintainable global state management.
- Often used in React and React Native apps.
- It provides a central store for the state, enabling better state management, debugging, and testing.
- In simple words it means that using redux the state of the application is stored in a single place (the Redux store)
and can be accessed and modified in a consistent and predictable manner.

#### 3.1.1 Why state management at central place?
When the state of an application is scattered across multiple components, it can become difficult to manage because it
becomes harder to keep track of where the state is being used and how it is being updated. This can lead to bugs and
inconsistencies in the behavior of the application.
By centralizing the state in a single location, such as the Redux store, it becomes easier to manage and update the state
in a consistent and predictable way. This can help to avoid conflicts and make it easier to debug issues when they arise.

### 3.2 Concepts

#### 3.2.1 State
- Single source of truth for application's data.
- It represents the current state of entire or specific part of application in a plain JavaScript object.
- Immutable, the only way to update it is by dispatching an action.
- Predictable.

#### 3.2.2 Actions
- A plain JavaScript object that describes the change one want to make to the state.
- Must have a type property (a string or symbol describing the action).
- They can also have a payload or any other fields to carry data.

#### 3.2.3 Reducer
- Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions.
- They are pure functions which takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state.
- They should not mutate the state directly but instead return new state objects.

#### 3.2.4 Store
- The store holds the application state and provides methods to interact with it.
- There's only one store in a Redux app.

### 3.3 Basic principles of redux.

#### 3.3.1 Single source of truth
- The Redux store is the single source of truth for the state of the application.
- All components that need access to the state can read it from the store.
#### 3.3.2 State is read-only
- The state in the Redux store is read-only, which means that components cannot modify it directly.
- Instead, they must dispatch actions to the store, which will update the state.
#### 3.3.3 Changes are made with pure functions
- Changes to the state are made with pure functions called reducers.
- Reducers take the current state and an action as input, and return a new state as output.
- This ensures that the state is updated in an immutable way, which makes it easier to reason about the behavior of the
application.
#### 3.3.4 Actions describe what happened
- Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened in the application.
- They contain a type property that identifies the type of action, as well as any additional data that is needed to
update the state.
#### 3.3.5 Changes are made asynchronously
- Changes to the state can be made asynchronously, which means that components can dispatch actions that trigger
asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API.
- Redux provides middleware, such as Redux Thunk, that makes it easy to handle asynchronous actions.
