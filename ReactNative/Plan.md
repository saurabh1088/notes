## 30-Minute Daily Learning Plan: Transitioning from Senior iOS Developer to React Native Expert

This plan is tailored for an experienced iOS engineer to efficiently master React Native, balancing hands-on practice and conceptual depth within a strict 30-minute daily window. It builds progressively from foundational skills to advanced cross-platform techniques, ensuring you gain both practical and strategic hybrid app expertise. 

### **Weeks 1–2: JavaScript & React Fundamentals**
- **Concepts:**  
  - Modern JavaScript (ES6+), classes, functions, async/await, modules.
  - Core React: components, props, state, lifecycle, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- **Hands-On:**  
  - Code along with [freeCodeCamp’s JavaScript and React modules].  
  - Build a simple web "counter" and "login form" using React.
- **Resources:**  
  - [React Official Docs – Learn](https://react.dev/learn)  
  - Codecademy: "Intro to JavaScript" & "React 18 for Beginners"

### **Weeks 3–4: React Native Basics & Setup**
- **Concepts:**  
  - Differences from SwiftUI/Swift: hybrid rendering, JavaScript bridge, component-based UI.
  - Core Elements: `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `ScrollView`, `StyleSheet`.
- **Hands-On:**  
  - Install Expo CLI. Start a basic "profile page" app in React Native.  
  - Tinker with navigation between 2–3 static screens.
- **Resources:**

  - Input Handling: `TextInput`
- **Hands-On:**  
  - Build a multi-screen to-do list with item addition/deletion and navigation.
  - Use local (React state) management for data.
- **Resources:**  
  - [React Navigation Docs](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/)
  - Expo Snack: Try [React Native ToDo example](https://snack.expo.dev/)

### **Weeks 7–8: Platform APIs & Styling**

  - Using device features: Camera, Location, Permissions (Expo/React Native APIs).
  - Flexbox-based styling vs SwiftUI/AutoLayout. Responsive design.
- **Hands-On:**  
  - Integrate image capture or geolocation into an app.
  - Style an existing app to adapt for various screen sizes/orientations.
- **Resources:**  
  - [Expo API Reference](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/)

  - Context API for shared state.
  - Bridging native code (Swift/Objective-C modules).
  - Performance: code splitting, lazy loading, Hermes JS engine.
- **Hands-On:**  
  - Add shared state (e.g., "favorites" or theme switcher).
  - Try a native module example: create a simple Swift bridge.
- **Resources:**  
  - [React Native Official Native Modules Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-intro)
  - [notJustDev’s React Native Mastery playlist] (YouTube)

### **Ongoing Learning & Project Milestones**
- **Every 2–3 weeks:**  
  Build a complete app or major feature:  
  - Ideas: Personal expenses tracker, chat UI, photo gallery, fitness logger.
  - Incrementally add: login screen, navigation, device APIs, persistent storage.
- **Engagement:**  
  - Contribute to or review React Native open-source repos.
  - Join community (Discord, Reddit r/reactnative, StackOverflow) for Q&A and tips.

### **Resources Summary**
- **Core Docs:**

### **Best Practices and Tips**
- *Leverage your iOS knowledge:* Write custom native modules in Swift for platform-specific needs.
- *Test on both platforms:* Cross-platform glitches are common—verify UI and device features on both simulators.
- *Optimize for performance:* Use profiling tools (Flipper, React DevTools), avoid heavy re-renders, and leverage FlatList for large data.
- *Document learning:* Maintain a public GitHub repo with code, notes, and findings.

> By consistently following this plan—balancing theory, daily coding, and real-world projects—you will confidently gain the skills needed to design, build, and ship robust React Native apps for both iOS and Android, while leveraging your deep iOS background for hybrid success.
