    - ReLU Restricted Linear Units
    - Binary Step function
- Hidden layers take weighted inputs
- Fundamental operating units of neural networks is vector
    - What are vectors?
        - For example columns in a spreadsheets are vectors
        - Columns and columns of vectors in arrays form matrices
- Loss functions
    - For example a trading system loss function should consider loss when one looses money not when one gains

## Image Convolution

### What is image convolution?
- Image convolution is a mathematical operation used in image processing and computer vision to extract features such as
    - edges, 
    - textures, 
    - or patterns. 
- It involves applying a small matrix, called a filter or kernel, across an image to produce a feature map (also called 
an activation map).

- Convolution on Images - What is image convolution operation?
    - Filter - Also referred to as kernel, usually 3x3 or 5x5
        - It is used to process an input image and transform that image to something that might be useful to downstream
        for processing.
    - Padding
    - Stride
    - Pooling

- Convonutional Neural Network (CNN)
    - Help to extract features from images leading to better learning for image classification.
