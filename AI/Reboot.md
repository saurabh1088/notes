## Computer Vision
- Convolution Layer
- Pulling

## Neural Networks
- Activation function
    - Sigmoid
    - Tanh
    - ReLU Restricted Linear Units
    - Binary Step function
- Hidden layers take weighted inputs
- Fundamental operating units of neural networks is vector
    - What are vectors?
        - For example columns in a spreadsheets are vectors
        - Columns and columns of vectors in arrays form matrices
- Loss functions
    - For example a trading system loss function should consider loss when one looses money not when one gains
