# Computer Vision


## What is Computer Vision?
- Computer Vision (CV) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to understand and interpret visual
data from the world such as
    - images,
    - videos, or
    - live camera feeds.
- Just like humans use eyes and the brain to see and understand the world,
    - computer vision allows machines to “see” and “understand” images using algorithms and models.
- Computer vision is accomplished by using large numbers of images to train a model.
- One can say that at its core, Computer Vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to "see" and "understand" digital images and videos in the same way humans do.
- It's about teaching machines to interpret and make sense of the visual world.
