#  TypeScript

TypeScript extends JavaScript syntax and adds strong typing to it.
One need to compile TypeScript code into JavaScript code before it can be run on
a JavaScript environment like browser or Node.js

File extension of a TypeScript file is .ts

For e.g. below is a valid JavaScript code and it won't cause any issues. However
this will not work with TypeScript.

```
let name = "Batman";
name = 120
```
