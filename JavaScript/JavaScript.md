#  JavaScript

Initially JavaScript used to be interpreted language, as when web browsers used
to come across JavaScript, they used to interpret it line by line and execute it
on the fly.

## Just In Time Compilation

Nowadays we have JavaScript engines like :
- V8 in Chrome
- SpiderMonkey in Firefox
- JavaScriptCore in Safari

These modern JavaScript engines employ a just-in-time (JIT) compilation process.
When code is compiled, then compiler converts source code into machine code and then
the generated machine code is executed. This process makes execution fast but startups
are slow due to time it takes for compilation.
Startup time is fast with interpreted languages as there the code is simply translated
and executed line by line. Problem with interpretation is that for any code which
lets say is getting repeated multiple times for example say in a loop then this
whole interpretation is going again and again which becomes inefficient.

Just In Time Compilation aims to fix this interpreterâ€™s inefficiency. JITs will
have a monitor or profiler which while code is getting executed by the interpreter
will keep track of how many times the different statements get hit. This way it
will detect parts of code being used most and those can be compiled and stored.

JavaScript however is still considered an interpreted language, since the compilation 
is handled at run time, rather than ahead of time.


JavaScript
- lightweight
- interpreted or just in time compiled
- first-class functions
- prototype-based
- multi-paradigm
- single-threaded
- dynamic language
- object-oriented
- imperative and declarative

On a web browser, each tab is having it's own environment for execution. This means
usually the code in each tab run completely independent of each other. This is good
from security point of view. There are however ways to safely send code and data 
between different websites/tabs
