#  JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language allowing one to implement complex
featured for a web page.

Initially JavaScript used to be interpreted language, as when web browsers used
to come across JavaScript, they used to interpret it line by line and execute it
on the fly.

## Just In Time Compilation

Nowadays we have JavaScript engines like :
- V8 in Chrome
- SpiderMonkey in Firefox
- JavaScriptCore in Safari

These modern JavaScript engines employ a just-in-time (JIT) compilation process.
When code is compiled, then compiler converts source code into machine code and then
the generated machine code is executed. This process makes execution fast but startups
are slow due to time it takes for compilation.
Startup time is fast with interpreted languages as there the code is simply translated
and executed line by line. Problem with interpretation is that for any code which
lets say is getting repeated multiple times for example say in a loop then this
whole interpretation is going again and again which becomes inefficient.

Just In Time Compilation aims to fix this interpreterâ€™s inefficiency. JITs will
have a monitor or profiler which while code is getting executed by the interpreter
will keep track of how many times the different statements get hit. This way it
will detect parts of code being used most and those can be compiled and stored.

JavaScript however is still considered an interpreted language, since the compilation 
is handled at run time, rather than ahead of time.


JavaScript
- lightweight
- interpreted or just in time compiled
- first-class functions
- prototype-based
- multi-paradigm
- single-threaded
- dynamic language
- object-oriented
- imperative and declarative
- dynamically typed

On a web browser, each tab is having it's own environment for execution. This means
usually the code in each tab run completely independent of each other. This is good
from security point of view. There are however ways to safely send code and data 
between different websites/tabs

## Adding JavaScript to HTML

### Internal JavaScript

```
<script>
  // Internal JavaScript code comes here
</script>
```

### External JavaScript

Internal JavaScript option works fine, but is not a great way to manage code. It's
a lot better to have JavaScript code live outside of HTML files with only reference
to the actual file from HTML.

```
<script src="externalJavaScript.js"></script>
```

### Inline JavaScript handlers

One can also have JavaScript literally living inside HTML. However this is BAD PRACTICE,
and should be AVOIDED.

```
<button onclick="buttonClickHandler()">Click me!</button>
```

## Script loading strategies in JavaScript

Webpages are loaded with HTML from top. There may happen issues wherein a JavaScript
loads and executed before the HTML content loads on which the JavaScript was expected
to perform some DOM manipulatiions, in this case it will give error.
One way to overcome this is to take help of event listener `DOMContentLoaded`

`DOMContentLoaded` is an event which signifies that HTML body is completely loaded
and parsed. One can put JavaScript logic manipulating DOM under this event check
so as to run only when HTML is completely loaded.

## JavaScript Objects

To create an object in JavaScript one can simply declare like below. This is creating
object using object literal. This is the easiest approach and one can both define
and create object in single line.

```
This will create an empty object employee
const employee = {}
```

```
const employee = {name: "Batman", employeeId: 1}
```

Another approach is to use *new Object()*

```
const employee = new Object()
employee.name = "Batman"
employee.employeeId = 1
```

Accessing the property can be done using dot notation and also using a bracket
notation.

```
console.log(employee.name)
console.log(employee["name"])
```


## JavaScript Object prototypes

Prototypes is a mechanism in JavaScript through which JavaScript objects inherit
properties and methods from other objects. 

Every object in JavaScript has a built in property i.e. *prototype*. This prototype
is basically a reference to another object which will have it's own *prototype*.
This creates a chain till the point when an object is reached which is having *null*
as it's *prototype*.

When a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript looks for it in
the object itself. If it doesn't find it, it looks in the object's prototype, and
so on, until it finds the property/method or reaches the end of the chain.

This *prototype* property for an object is not called prototype, all browsers use
*__proto__*. Usage of *__proto__* is discouraged as per official documentation.
Source : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto

Standard way to access an object's prototype is *Object.getPrototypeOf()* method.

### Setting a prototype

Prototype for an object in JavaScript can be set while creating the object using
*Object.create()* method.


```
const employee = {name: "Batman", powers() { console.log("Because I'am Batman")}}

Create a prototype of employee which will inherit all from it.
const employeePrototype = Object.create(employee)

console.log(employee.powers)
console.log(employeePrototype.powers())

Both will print "Because I'am Batman"
```

In the example above an object *employee* was defined and then a prototype was
created using it. The prototype object created *employeePrototype* inherits all
properties and methods defined from object it was created.

One can get the prototype of *employeePrototype* like below, note however *__proto__*
is NOT recommended.

```
NOT RECOMMENDED
console.log(employeePrototype.__proto__)

RECOMMENDED
console.log(Object. getPrototypeOf(employeePrototype))
```

JavaScript is a prototype-based language
JavaScript follows Prototype-Based Inheritance

### Classes in JavaScript

Classes in JavaScript were introduced from ES6. With introduction of class keyword,
JavaScript also got a traditional class-based way of creating objects. This introduction
enabled a more convenient way to create a constructors and work with prototypes.

JavaScript's inheritance model still remains prototype-based, even after introduction
of class keyword.

*class* in JavaScript is actually a syntactic sugar over the existing prototype
based system.

So basically class keyword provides a more familiar and clean syntax for creating
objects and their methods, but under the hood, it still uses prototypes to link
objects and inherit properties and methods.


## Asynchronous JavaScript

JavaScript is single-threaded. This implicated it will only execute one thing at
a time. It has only one execution thread in it's runtime environment (be it browser
or Node.js).

This single thread in JavaScript is hence responsible for lot of things :
- Executing code
- Event handling
- DOM handling

Now in order to support tasks which can be potentially long running, synchronous
operations for those wouldn't make sense. Luckily JavaScript supports asynchronous
programming which allows those operations to be executed asynchronously without
blocking and achieving concurrent like behaviour.

Note however asynchronous tasks in JavaScript won't be creating any additional thread,
instead an event loop within the main thread itself will handle those operations
efficiently.

## JavaScript declare variables/constants

### const, let and var

*let* is used in JavaScript to declare a variable (unlike Swift where let is used
to declare a constant)

```
let someVariable = "some value";
someVariable = "some other value";
```

*var* is another way to declare a variable in JavaScript. So basically one can
declare a variable in JavaScript using *let* OR *var* (Contrast this with Swift
where *let* declares a constant and *var* a variable)

### About let and var

When JavaScript was created *var* was only way to declare variables. Due to issues
with few aspects of *var*, *let* was introduced in modern JavaScript to erase the
issues with *var*. Few difference in these two are :

- With *var* in a multiline JavaScript program one can actually declare a variable
with *var* after it's initialized and code will work just fine. This happens due
to *Hoisting*

- With *var* redeclaration is possible

What is hoisting?
*Hoisting* in JavaScript is a process via which interpreter appears to move
declarations of functions, variables etc to the top of their scope before execution.
Declaration anywhere in code is equivalent to declaring right at top, hence it also
means that the variable can appear to be used before being declared itself.

This code is completely valid and won't give any issues, provided one is not executing
this line by line in console.

```
someVar = "value";
var someVar;
```

However one important point to be noted is that only the declaration is hoiseted
but not the initialization so below code will give error

```
console.log(someVar); // undefined
var someVar = "value";
```

Should one use *var* now?

Features supported by *var* like hoisting and redeclaration are confusing. Hence
it is advisable to use *let* instead, there is no reason in using *var* now as all
modern browsers support *let*.

### const

*const* in JavaScript is used to create constants, these need to be initialized
while declaration itself and can't be assigned new value post that.

However if *const* is refering to an object, then the object itself can be updated.
Note that only object properties can be updated, being declared a const, the const
can't be assigned a new object.

```
const someObject = { name: "Batman" };
someObject.name = "Superman";
```

## JavaScript Events

JavaScript Events are actions happening in browser in response to user interactions
or possibly some other events.

An Event can be :
- a button clicked
- a page loading
- a video playing
- cursor moved
etc.

There are Event listeners which observes events and call event handlers. Event handlers
are blocks of code running in response to event firing.


Example below shows how to use event handler in HTML
```
<button onclick="buttonTapped()">Click me</button>

function buttonTapped() {
  alert("Button tapped!");
}
```

However a better practice is to use like below, using this way the code is all in
JavaScript file and HTML is seperated leading to flexibility and separation of concern.
```
var button = document.getElementById("someButton");

button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Button tapped!");
});
```

## Number

Unlike other programming languages having different types for integer and decimal
types, for example Swift has Int, Float, Double etc, JavaScript has single data 
type i.e. *Number*

```
var someInteger = 1;
var someFloat = 2.5;
typeof someInteger; // prints 'number'
typeof someFloat; // prints 'number'
```

## Strings

### Single quotes, double quotes, and backticks

Strings can be declared in JavaScript using single quotes, double quotes or backticks.
Using single quotes OR double quotes is same.

String declared using backticks are a special kind of strings. These strings are
called *template literal* and these have some special properties.

Using *template literal* one can :
- embed JavaScript in these strings
- declare multiple lines
