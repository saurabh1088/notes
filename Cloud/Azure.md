## Resource Group

- In Microsoft Azure, a Resource Group is a logical container that holds related Azure resources for an application or project.
- It helps one manage and organize resources like virtual machines, databases, storage accounts, web apps, and more â€” as a single unit.
- A Resource Group is like a folder where one places all one's Azure resources that share a common lifecycle (same app,
same environment, same owner, etc.).
    - For example: While building a web app. One can put the App Service, Azure SQL Database, and Storage Account into one
    resource group called MyWebApp-RG.
