# System Design

## What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining 
- architecture
- interfaces
- & data
for a system.

In software engineering system design is the process which defines the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, data
etc for a system based on requirements.
System design is a phase in software development life cycle. Major goal of system design is to translate the requirements
such that those can be implemented in efficient and effective manner.

## System Design fundamentals

### Scalability

An application's ability to handle increased workload without sacrificing latency(delay in operation, for e.g. could be network
latency, or event latency).

1. Horizontal Scaling
For example adding more hardware to handle load.

2. Vertical Scaling
For example adding more capability to existing hardware to handle load.
