# Threat Modeling


`Threat Modeling is a PROACTIVE approach`


## What is Threat Modeling?
- Threat modeling is a structured process used to identify, understand, and mitigate potential security threats and vulnerabilities in a system, application, or business process.
- It's a proactive approach 
    - that helps one anticipate what could go wrong and how to defend against it
    - rather than reacting to security incidents after they've occurred


## Real life analogies
- Think of it like an architect designing a building. Before construction begins, they consider all potential risks:
earthquakes, fires, floods, intruders. They then design in safeguards (reinforced foundations, sprinkler systems, secure
locks) to protect against these threats. Threat modeling does the same for software and systems.


## Core questions threat modeling aims to answer
- What are we building?
- What can go wrong?
- What are we going to do about that?
- Did we do a good enough job?
