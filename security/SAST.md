# Static Application Security Testing


## What is Static Application Security Testing (SAST)?
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST), is a software testing methodology.
- It is used to analyze an application's 
    - source code,
    - bytecode, or
    - binary code
        - for
            - security vulnerabilities without actually executing the application


## What is SAST often referred to as?
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is also referred to as
    - white-box testing
    - static code analysis


## Key characteristics of Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
### Non-execution based
- SAST doesn't needs a running application
- SAST can be run as soon as code is written, even before code is fully functional
- SAST is ideal for integrating it early in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

### White box approach
- SAST has full access to internal workings of the code
