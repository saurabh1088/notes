# OWASP

## What is OWASP?
Open Worldwide Application Security Project
It is nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software.


## Is OWASP web only?
OWASP primarily focuses on web application security only, however its principles and guidelines can be extended beyond web
applications.
Also we have OWASP Mobile Application Security (MAS), which provides security standard for mobile apps.

OWASP MAS provides us with:
- OWASP MASVS : OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard
- OWASP MASTG : OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide


## OWASP top 10
OWASP regularly updates the top 10 most critical risks facing applications. OWASP top 10 represents a broad consensus about 
the most critical security risks to web applications.

### 1. Broken Access Control
Access control in an application governs policies so that users should not be able to perform actions beyond their intended
permissions.

### 2. Cryptographic Failures
Sensitive data in application need proper protection using cryptographic means. Data like passwords, credit card numbers,
personal information etc need to be protected from unauthorized access.
- There's EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Issues like SQL injections when user input is not validated and filtered.

### 4. Insecure Design
### 5. Security Misconfiguration
