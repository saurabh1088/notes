# OOPS in Swift

## Abstraction
Abstraction separates ideas from specific details.
Generics are a fundamental tool for writing abstract code in Swift.

Different ways to achieve abstraction:

### Functions & Methods

## Encapsulation
Literal meaning : *The process of expressing or showing the most important facts about something*

Encapsulation by definition means bundling of data and methods which operate on data in a single unit.
