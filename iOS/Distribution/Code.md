# Code Distribution

While developing software solutions one can't write everything. There are various functionalities which are already available
and those could be utilised to avoid re-inventing everything and speed up development time. Also at times one needs to develop
some functionality once and re-use it elsewhere.
In both the above cases there is a need for packaging and distributing software so as to re-use it in projects. This is
where libraries, frameworks and packages comes in.

## Libraries
A Library is a collection of *object files* which the program which imports can link to. Libraries contain only the executable
code. Libraries in Apple ecosystem can be of two types :-

1. Static Library
2. Dynamic Library

### Static Library


### Dynamic Library
