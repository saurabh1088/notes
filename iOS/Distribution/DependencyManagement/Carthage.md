# Carthage

_The role of a dependency manager is to automate the process of downloading and building all of the dependencies for a project, and minimize the coordination costs associated with code reuse._

Carthage is probably the simplest way to add dependencies to project. Carthage builds and adds dependencies without
modifying any project files or structure.

## How to use Carthage?
Carthage should be installed on system. Having done that, one needs to add a *cartfile* in the directory where *.xcodeproj*
or *.xcworkspace* files reside.
