# App Distribution

## Why Code Signing?
Code signing process ensures `security` & `integrity` of the app.
The process establishes trust between:-
- The App
- The Device
- The Developer

*Signing app allows iOS to identify who signed the app and to verify that the app hasn’t been modified since it was signed*

## iOS App Code Signing
### Signing Certificate
A certificate guarantees that one knows Apple and Apple knows the developer.
There is a mutual recognition.
Another way to look at it is that the developer of app needs to identify himself/herself to Apple.
This is done by creating a certificate and asking Apple to sign it. For this purpose one creates a Certificate Signing Request.
Once one gets certificate and adds to keychain, any build signed by Xcode uses this certificate which guarantees the code is coming from authorised person or team.

There are two flavours of signing certificate
- 1. Development Certificate
    - This one need in order to build code and install on a device using Xcode.
    - A development certificate identifies one as a developer and contains the developer identifier.
    - Even when one signs up as an apple developer as an individual, one still have both a developer and team identifier.
- 2. Distribution Certificate
    - Required to distribute app to Testflight or to App store.
    - Belong to the team
    - A distribution certificate contains one’s team identifier and identifies a team.

The signing certificate is a public private pair with

- Private key
    - Resides in keychain of build machine(For e.g. the MacBook or iMac)
- Public
    - User ID
    - Team ID
    - Public key


### How to create a signing certificate?
- Create a Certificate Signing Request using the keychain Access app from Mac
- This creates the public and private keys that will identify one’s certificate

### Provisioning Profiles
A provisional profile may contain:
1. Distribution type
2. Signing Certificate
3. Team/Developer ID
4. Entitlements
5. Destination Devices (UUIDs)

Following are types of provisioning profiles :
1. Development Provisioning Profile
    - This profile contains device's UUIDs for all devices which are expected to install app 
2. Distribution Provisioning Profile
    - Ad-hoc provisioning profile
        - Generally used to distribut app to Testflight testers
        - This profile contains device's UUIDs for all devices which are expected to install app
    - Enterprise provisioning profile : TODO Not sure if this is relevant
    - App store provisioning profile
        - No UUIDs are required here

### How to create a development provisioning profile?
- Sign in with developer account on http://developer.apple.com
- Go to Certificate, Identifier and Profiles
- Under profiles there should be a + button to add a new profile.
- Tap + and under Development select appropriate type of profile needed.
- Select the App ID needed for development
- Select all development certificates which are needed
- Select devices which are required
- Enter a profile name, and generate then download

### App ID vs Bundle ID vs Team ID
- App ID
    - App ID is combination of Team ID and Bundle ID
- Bundle ID
    - Uniquely identifies an application in Apple's ecosystem
    - Apple encourages to use reverse domain name notation
- Team ID
    - Generated by Apple for a development team

```
App ID = Team ID . Bundle ID

For e.g.
ABCDE12345.com.apple.saurabh.SomeAppProject
Here ABCDE12345 is Team ID
com.apple.saurabh.SomeAppProject is reverse domain Bundle ID
Combined, ABCDE12345.com.apple.saurabh.SomeAppProject is the App ID
```

## Notes
- Images, nib files are not signed, so changes to these doesn't invalidates the signature.

## TODOs
- [x] Move size classes to proper place.
