# Frameworks

## Where is product when a framework project is built with Xcode?
Initially in Xcode project navigator itself one could see the generated product once the framework was built. Now however
it is not visible in Xcoce. To go to product folder one needs to go to derived data directory in Finder. Or a shortcut way
to reach there is using following Xcode menu option :-

Xcode -> Product -> Show Build Folder in Finder

## TODOs

- [ ] How to build a framework for devices and simulators via xcode and command line
- [ ] Add command line scripts and document those for further usage
- [ ] How to create release framework and publish it on GitHub
