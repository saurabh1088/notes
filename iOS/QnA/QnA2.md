## 5. Networking and Data Management
- Explain your experience with network handling in iOS, including error handling, retry mechanisms, and request caching. How would you manage networking in a large-scale iOS app?
- What approaches do you use to handle offline data synchronization in an app? How would you design an architecture that maintains data consistency across devices?
- What is your experience with using Core Data in a large project? How do you handle data migrations?
- How do you handle paginated API responses in SwiftUI, particularly when loading data dynamically as the user scrolls?
- What’s your approach to implementing real-time data updates in an iOS app? How would you handle push notifications and in-app updates?


## 6. Security, Privacy, and Compliance
- How do you ensure data security and user privacy in iOS applications, particularly for sensitive data like authentication tokens?
- What are some best practices for securely storing user data in an iOS app? How do you handle secure storage and retrieval of tokens or keys?
- What security considerations do you take into account when integrating third-party SDKs?
- Explain your approach to handling user permissions, such as location, camera, and microphone access. How do you ensure compliance with App Store guidelines and user privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)?
- How do you mitigate potential security vulnerabilities in Swift applications, such as SSL pinning, secure authentication, and preventing reverse engineering?


## 7. Testing and Continuous Integration (CI/CD)
- What is your approach to testing in iOS applications, particularly when balancing between unit tests, UI tests, and integration tests?
- How do you manage dependency injection in testing to allow for isolated unit testing?
- What CI/CD tools have you used for automating the build and deployment process? How do you ensure that code quality is maintained in the pipeline?
- How would you set up a testing strategy for a new app, including test environments, code coverage goals, and team workflows?
- Can you describe a challenging bug or issue you encountered and how you identified, debugged, and resolved it?


## 8. Leadership and Collaboration
- How do you approach architectural decision-making on a project? What factors do you consider when choosing a technology or architecture pattern?
- Can you describe a time when you had to refactor legacy code in a large project? How did you prioritize what to refactor, and what was your approach?
- How do you handle disagreements about architectural decisions or design choices with your team?
- Describe your experience mentoring and guiding junior developers. How do you foster a culture of learning and best practices within a team?
- What strategies do you use to ensure that your team adheres to coding standards and architectural guidelines?


## 9. Monitoring and Analytics
- How do you implement monitoring for app crashes and errors? What tools do you prefer, and how do you handle error tracking in production?
- What’s your approach to collecting and analyzing user behavior data within an app? How do you balance the need for data with user privacy?
