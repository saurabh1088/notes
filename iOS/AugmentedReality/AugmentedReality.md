#  Augmented Reality

## What is an Augmented Reality experience?

Augmented Reality is a technology which belnds digital pieces which could be 2D or
3D with the real world environment.
Augmented Reality tries to seamlessly blend and marry a digital piece with a real
environment, this enhances user's perception and experience which has wide range
of use cases in apps and games.

Modern devices are equipped with cameras and sensors which capture the real world
environment surrounding them and using that are capable to place digital pieces.

While in a Virtual Reality (VR) the technology takes user and immerses user into
an experience which essentially replaces everything user sees in physical world.
Augmented Reality (AR) on the other hand keeps the world around the user same but
adds virtual objects to it.

## ARKit

ARKit is a framework provided by Apple which helps to integrate device's hardware
sensing features within the app thereby producing augmented reality apps and games.

ARKit provides AR (Augmented Reality) experience by combining :
- Device motion tracking
- World tracking
- Scene understanding
