#  UI Automation in Xcode

Source : https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/344/


### Overview

UI automation in Xcode enables you to test your app’s user interface and workflows across multiple devices, languages, and configurations with minimal effort. It provides the ability to record interactions, replay them on various configurations, and review results with video recordings and detailed reports.

### Testing Frameworks

- **Swift Testing** and **XCTest** are the primary frameworks for testing in Xcode.
- Importing `XCTest` automatically includes the `XCUIAutomation` framework.
- **XCUIAutomation** allows automation of app interactions, simulating user gestures and hardware events.

### Types of Tests

- **Unit Tests:** Validate app logic and models, can be run on code without a UI.
- **UI Automation Tests:** Validate user experience, integration with hardware, and common workflows.

### Benefits of UI Automation

- Simulate user gestures (taps, swipes, clicks).
- Test accessibility features (VoiceOver, Voice Control, Dynamic Type).
- Validate localization and layout for different languages and regions.
- Test integration with hardware features (Action button, camera, Apple TV remote, Digital Crown).
- Measure app launch performance.

### UI Automation Workflow

1. **Record:** Capture user interactions as automation code.
2. **Replay:** Run recorded interactions across devices, languages, and orientations, both locally and in Xcode Cloud.
3. **Review:** Analyze video recordings and reports to determine pass/fail status.

### Platform Support

- UI automation is supported on all Apple platforms: iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS.
- Automations can be reused across platforms.

### How UI Automation Works

- Interacts with the app via gestures and hardware events, independently from app code.
- Actions include launching the app, interacting with UI elements, changing system state (e.g., Dark Mode), and simulating device location.

### Accessibility and UI Automation

- Accessibility is foundational for UI automation.
- Accessibility provides element types, labels, values, and frames to automation.
- **Accessibility Identifiers** (`accessibilityIdentifier` in UIKit, `.accessibilityIdentifier()` in SwiftUI) uniquely identify UI elements for automation and are not localized or exposed to users.
- **Accessibility Inspector** (Xcode tool) helps diagnose and improve accessibility, which enhances automation reliability.

### Best Practices for Accessibility Identifiers

- Make identifiers unique, descriptive, and static.
- Use identifiers for elements with dynamic or localized content.
- In SwiftUI: Use `.accessibilityIdentifier()` modifier.
- In UIKit: Set `accessibilityIdentifier` property on `UIView`.

### Preparing for UI Automation

- Add accessibility identifiers to relevant UI elements.
- Review app accessibility using Accessibility Inspector.
- Add a new UI Testing target in Xcode to store automation code.

### Recording UI Tests

- Use Xcode’s UI recording feature to capture interactions as Swift code.
- Recorded code can be edited and enhanced with validations using XCTest APIs.

### Working with Recorded Code

- Review and adjust UI queries for resilience and clarity.
- Prefer accessibility identifiers for localized or dynamic elements.
- Use shortest queries for deeply nested views.
- For dynamic content, use generic queries or identifiers.

### Validating UI Automation

- Use APIs like `waitForExistence` and `wait(for:toEqual:)` on `XCUIElement` to synchronize and validate UI state.
- Pair with `XCTAssert` statements to enforce expected outcomes.

### Enhancing Automation

- Use `setUp` in `XCTestCase` to configure device state (orientation, appearance, simulated location).
- Use `launchArguments` and `launchEnvironment` to control app launch parameters.
- Open custom URL schemes with `XCUIApplication.open`.
- Perform accessibility audits within UI tests.

### Test Plans and Configurations

- **Test Plans** allow organizing tests, setting system settings, and managing properties like timeouts, repetitions, and execution order.
- Configure tests to run in multiple languages and locales.
- Use configurations for languages with long strings or right-to-left layouts.
- Control video and screenshot capture settings for test runs.

### Xcode Cloud Integration

- Xcode Cloud automates building, testing, and distributing apps in the cloud.
- Test plans can be executed in Xcode Cloud across multiple devices and configurations.
- Results, logs, and video recordings are accessible to the team via Xcode and App Store Connect.

### Reviewing Test Results

- Use the Xcode test report to analyze test outcomes, view video recordings, and diagnose failures.
- Overlay UI elements on video to identify issues and get code recommendations for automation.
- Download videos for documentation or troubleshooting.

### Additional Resources

- Explore sample projects and articles on accessibility and testing in Apple’s developer documentation.
- Sessions on advanced topics like accessibility audits, test plans, and Xcode Cloud workflows are available for deeper learning.
