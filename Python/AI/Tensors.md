# Tensors in Python


- To explore tensors in Python, one primarily uses libraries like 
    - `NumPy` (which provides the foundational multi-dimensional array concept) and
    - deep learning frameworks like
        - `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch` (which implement specialized tensor objects for neural networks, often with GPU acceleration).


## What are Tensors?
- A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to an arbitrary number of dimensions.
    - Scalar: A single number (0-dimensional tensor).
    - Vector: A list of numbers (1-dimensional tensor).
    - Matrix: A 2D array of numbers (2-dimensional tensor).
    - Tensor: An n-dimensional array of numbers.


## Tensors as NumPy Arrays (ndarray)
- NumPy's `ndarray` is the fundamental data structure for numerical computing in Python and serves as the conceptual basis for tensors in deep learning.
