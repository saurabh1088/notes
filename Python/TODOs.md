    8. [ ] Can you explain how metaclasses work and give a use case where you used or would use them?
    9. [ ] How do you ensure type safety and code robustness in Python given its dynamic nature?
    10. [ ] How would you implement a plugin system using Python?

‚∏ª

- [ ] üß± Design Patterns & System Architecture

    2. [ ] How would you structure a large-scale Python project with multiple modules, teams, and release pipelines?
    3. [ ] Can you walk through how you designed a scalable Python-based microservice or API system?
    4. [ ] How would you handle versioning and backward compatibility in a large Python codebase?
    5. [ ] Describe a situation where you had to refactor legacy Python code. What approach did you take?

‚∏ª

- [ ] üõ† Tooling & Ecosystem
    1. [ ] What tools or libraries do you typically use for:
        - [ ] Dependency management?
        - [ ] Linting and formatting?
        - [ ] Unit and integration testing?
        - [ ] Profiling and performance tuning?
    2. [ ] Have you worked with type annotations and tools like mypy? What benefits or challenges have you seen?
    3. [ ] Which Python web frameworks have you used (e.g., Django, Flask, FastAPI)? How do you choose between them?

‚∏ª

- [ ] üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance
    1. [ ] How do you design a test strategy for a mission-critical Python application?
    2. [ ] How do you ensure high code coverage without writing unnecessary tests?
    3. [ ] Share a scenario where a well-written test saved a production issue.
    4. [ ] How do you approach mocking external dependencies in unit tests?

‚∏ª

- [ ] ‚òÅÔ∏è DevOps & Deployment
    1. [ ] What‚Äôs your experience deploying Python applications to production?
    2. [ ] How do you containerize Python apps, and what best practices do you follow (e.g., Docker)?
    3. [ ] Have you worked with CI/CD pipelines? How do you integrate Python applications into them?

‚∏ª

- [ ] üí¨ Soft Skills / Leadership / Mentoring
    1. [ ] How do you mentor junior developers to grow in Python?
    2. [ ] Have you been in situations where you had to defend or challenge a technology choice? How did you approach it?
    3. [ ] How do you handle technical debt in a team where delivery timelines are tight?
    4. [ ] How do you conduct code reviews? What do you emphasize beyond correctness?

‚∏ª

- [ ] üß† Problem Solving & Scenario-Based
    1. [ ] You are given a monolithic Python codebase that‚Äôs difficult to maintain. What steps would you take to refactor it?
    2. [ ] You suspect a memory leak in a long-running Python service. How would you diagnose and fix it?
    3. [ ] A new team member pushes code that slows down your data pipeline by 2x. How would you handle this technically and interpersonally?
    4. [ ] You are tasked with building a Python-based solution that ingests and processes real-time data from thousands of IoT devices. How would you design this system?
