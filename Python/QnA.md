While Python's execution speed can sometimes be a concern for CPU-bound tasks compared to compiled languages like Java or C++, its benefits in development speed, readability, extensive ecosystem, and integration capabilities often outweigh this for many enterprise-scale applications, especially when combined with optimized critical components written in other languages or by leveraging cloud infrastructure for scalability.


## How do generators differ from iterators in Python?

In Python, both generators and iterators are fundamental concepts related to iteration, but they differ in their creation
and how they function.

### Here's a breakdown of their differences:

#### Iterators
An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It implements the iterator protocol, which consists of two methods:


__iter__(self): This method returns the iterator object itself. It allows an object to be iterable (meaning you can use it in a for loop).

__next__(self): This method returns the next item from the sequence. If there are no more items, it must raise the StopIteration exception.

Key characteristics of iterators:

Explicitly Defined: You typically define an iterator by creating a class that implements the __iter__ and __next__ methods.
Stateful: Iterators maintain their internal state (i.e., where they are in the sequence) to know what the next item is.
Manual Implementation: Creating custom iterators often involves more boilerplate code.
Can be finite or infinite: Iterators can represent a finite sequence (like a list) or an infinite sequence (like counting numbers).

#### Generators

Python generators are a powerful and memory-efficient way to create iterators. They are especially useful when you need to process a large sequence of data but don't want to load the entire sequence into memory at once.

Concept of Python Generators
At their core, generators are functions that, instead of returning a single value and exiting, yield a sequence of values over time. When a yield statement is encountered in a generator function, the function's state is frozen, and the yielded value is returned. The next time the generator is called (e.g., in a for loop), it resumes execution from where it left off.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

yield keyword: This is what makes a function a generator. Instead of return, yield is used to send a value back to the caller.

State Suspension: When yield is executed, the function's local variables and execution state are saved. This allows the generator to resume from that exact point when the next value is requested.

Laziness/On-Demand Generation: Generators produce values one at a time, only when requested. This is in contrast to regular functions that compute and return all values at once.

Iterators: Generators are automatically iterators. This means you can use them directly in for loops, next() calls, and other constructs that expect an iterable.

Why use Generators?
Memory Efficiency: This is the primary advantage. For very large datasets, generating values on demand significantly reduces memory consumption because you don't need to store the entire sequence in memory.

Performance: In some cases, generators can be faster because they don't incur the overhead of building and returning an entire list.

Infinite Sequences: Generators can represent infinite sequences of data (e.g., all natural numbers) because they only generate values as needed.

Cleaner Code: They can make code more readable and concise when dealing with iterative processes.

## Discuss in depth about concept of mutability in Python.

- In Python, every piece of data is an object.
- Objects have a value and an identity (memory address).
- The key difference between mutable and immutable objects lies in whether their value can be changed after they are
created, while their identity remains the same.

### Immutable Objects
- Object whose state (value) cannot be modified after it is created.
- Changing an immutable object, instead creates a new object with desired new value with new identity.

#### Common Immutable Types in Python
- `int`, `float`, `complex`, `bool`

### Mutable Objects
- A mutable object is an object whose state (value) can be modified after it is created without changing its identity
(memory address).
- A mutable object cannot be used as dictionary keys or set members because their hash value could change, breaking the
hash table's integrity.

#### Common Mutable Types in Python
- `list`, `set`, `dict`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`

## The key of a dictionary in Python can be mutable or immutable? Why or why not?
- The key of a dictionary in Python must be immutable.

### The why of it
- Python dictionaries are implemented as hash tables.
- A hash table works by taking the key, passing it through a hash function, which computes an integer hash value.
- This hash value is then used to determine the memory location (or "bucket") where the key-value pair will be stored.
- When one later tries to retrieve a value using a key,
    - the same hash function is applied to the key, and 
        - the dictionary goes directly to that calculated memory location to find the value.

### What if mutable keys are allowed
- If a key were mutable (e.g., a list or a set), its content could change after it has been used as a key in the dictionary.
- If the content changes, its hash value would also change.
- Now, when one tries to look up the key again (even if it's the "same" object, but with modified content),
    - the dictionary would calculate a different hash value.
- This different hash value would lead it to a different memory location (bucket) than where the key-value pair was originally stored.
- The dictionary would then fail to find the key, even though it technically exists in the dictionary's storage.
    - This breaks the fundamental lookup mechanism of a hash table.
