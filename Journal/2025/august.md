### Prompts
```
Create a focused, time-efficient learning plan for a X_REPLACE_ME_X (X_REPLACE_ME_X years IT experience, X_REPLACE_ME_X years iOS/Swift/SwiftUI) seeking to transition into hybrid app development with React Native. The plan should:

Be structured for a maximum of 30 minutes of learning per day.

Combine hands-on coding exercises, conceptual learning, and guided projects.

Leverage the developerâ€™s prior native mobile experience (especially in iOS).

Include suggested resources: official docs, high-quality courses, and practical tutorials.

Progress from fundamentals (JavaScript/React) to advanced React Native concepts (navigation, performance, native modules).

Highlight cross-platform differences, best practices, and app optimization strategies.

Periodically schedule project-based milestones for deeper comprehension.

The end goal: Within a practical timeframe, enable the developer to confidently build, test, optimize, and publish real-world React Native mobile apps for both iOS and Android.

### Prompts
```
You are a JavaScript architect with 30 years of experience in building large-scale, high-performance web applications. Explain in detail:



Value vs. Reference Types in JavaScript:

Does JavaScript use value semantics, reference semantics, or both?

How does JavaScript distinguish between primitive and non-primitive types in this context?

Memory Management & Data Representation:

How are different data types (primitives, objects, functions, arrays, etc.) stored and referenced in memory?

What happens under the hood when variables are assigned, copied, or passed as function arguments?

Behavioral Implications:

Why do primitives appear to behave as values, while objects behave as references?

How does immutability (or lack thereof) factor into this model?

Best Practices & Pitfalls:

Common misconceptions developers have about value vs. reference behavior in JavaScript.

Patterns or techniques to avoid unintended side effects when working with objects and arrays.

Provide clear explanations with code examples and conceptual diagrams (if helpful) to illustrate memory behavior and semantics.
