        - Added notes
            - https://github.com/saurabh1088/notes/blob/main/JavaScript/JustInTimeCompilation.md

### Prompts
```
Create a focused, time-efficient learning plan for a X_REPLACE_ME_X (X_REPLACE_ME_X years IT experience, X_REPLACE_ME_X years iOS/Swift/SwiftUI) seeking to transition into hybrid app development with React Native. The plan should:

Be structured for a maximum of 30 minutes of learning per day.

Combine hands-on coding exercises, conceptual learning, and guided projects.

Leverage the developerâ€™s prior native mobile experience (especially in iOS).

Include suggested resources: official docs, high-quality courses, and practical tutorials.

Progress from fundamentals (JavaScript/React) to advanced React Native concepts (navigation, performance, native modules).

Highlight cross-platform differences, best practices, and app optimization strategies.

Periodically schedule project-based milestones for deeper comprehension.

The end goal: Within a practical timeframe, enable the developer to confidently build, test, optimize, and publish real-world React Native mobile apps for both iOS and Android.

### Prompts
```
You are a JavaScript architect with 30 years of experience in building large-scale, high-performance web applications. Explain in detail:



Value vs. Reference Types in JavaScript:

Does JavaScript use value semantics, reference semantics, or both?

How does JavaScript distinguish between primitive and non-primitive types in this context?

Memory Management & Data Representation:

How are different data types (primitives, objects, functions, arrays, etc.) stored and referenced in memory?

What happens under the hood when variables are assigned, copied, or passed as function arguments?

Behavioral Implications:

Why do primitives appear to behave as values, while objects behave as references?

How does immutability (or lack thereof) factor into this model?

Best Practices & Pitfalls:

Common misconceptions developers have about value vs. reference behavior in JavaScript.

Patterns or techniques to avoid unintended side effects when working with objects and arrays.

Provide clear explanations with code examples and conceptual diagrams (if helpful) to illustrate memory behavior and semantics.

### Prompts
```
As a veteran software engineering architect, discuss Concurrency and Parallelism in depth. Beyond defining each, elaborate on their practical implications and trade-offs in building large-scale, high-performance systems.

Specifically, address the following from an engineering perspective:

Fundamental Concepts & Distinctions:

Revisit the core definitions, emphasizing the difference between managing multiple tasks (concurrency) and simultaneously executing multiple tasks (parallelism).

Explain how a single-core system can achieve concurrency, and why true parallelism requires multi-core hardware.

Architectural Patterns & Design Choices:

When would you choose a concurrent design (e.g., event loops, async/await, coroutines) over a parallel design (e.g., multi-threading, distributed computing), and vice-versa? Provide real-world system examples (e.g., web servers, data processing pipelines).

Discuss common architectural patterns for implementing each (e.g., Actor Model, Thread Pools, Message Queues).

Performance & Scalability Implications:

How do concurrency and parallelism impact system responsiveness, throughput, and latency?

Discuss the challenges of scalability with each approach, including Amdahl's Law and Gustafson's Law.

Address the overheads associated with context switching, synchronization, and communication between concurrent/parallel units.

Challenges & Pitfalls:

Detail common problems like deadlocks, race conditions, starvation, and contention.

Explain debugging strategies and tools for identifying and resolving these issues in complex systems.

Discuss the complexity of state management in concurrent and parallel environments.

Language & Platform Specifics (Illustrative Examples):

Briefly touch upon how different languages (e.g., JavaScript/Node.js, Python, Java/Go/Rust) approach concurrency and parallelism, highlighting their built-in mechanisms and common libraries.

Provide examples of how these concepts manifest in real-world engineering scenarios (e.g., a high-traffic API, a batch processing job, a real-time analytics dashboard).

Future Trends & Best Practices:

What emerging trends (e.g., WebAssembly, serverless, new language features) are shaping the future of concurrency and parallelism in web applications and backend systems?

What are your top 3 best practices for designing, implementing, and maintaining robust concurrent/parallel systems?

This refined prompt aims to elicit a comprehensive, experience-driven discussion that directly addresses the practical concerns and strategic decisions faced by software engineers in the field

- AI
    - Added file for Linear Algebra in AI
        - https://github.com/saurabh1088/notes/blob/main/AI/LinearAlgebra.md

### Prompts
```
Design a step-by-step AI learning roadmap for an experienced software developer who wants to go beyond theoretical knowledge. The goal is to:

Understand AI fundamentals and advanced concepts,

Learn how to architect solutions that integrate AI into software development workflows, and

Identify practical strategies to leverage AI for measurable business and technical benefits.
The roadmap should combine conceptual understanding, hands-on practice, and real-world application, with recommendations for tools, frameworks, and reference materials.
