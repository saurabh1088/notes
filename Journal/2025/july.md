- Prompt

```
Explain the practical, real-world advantages of using iterators in Python, providing at least three distinct use cases. For each use case, include:

A clear explanation of the problem that iterators help solve, highlighting why they are a superior solution compared to alternative approaches (e.g., loading all data into memory).

A brief, illustrative code example that demonstrates the use of iterators in that specific context.

A concise explanation of the code and how the iterator contributes to efficiency, memory management, or other benefits.

Focus on scenarios where iterators offer tangible benefits in terms of performance, resource consumption, or code elegance.
