# Data Structures

_Data structure is a way of organising data such that it can be used effectively_


## Why Data Structures?
- These are essential ingredients to write fast, powerful algorithms solving problems.
- Manage and organise data efficiently
- Clean and organised code


## Abstract Data Type vs Data Structures
1. Physical
2. Logical


## The Big-O Notation
_Big-O notation is a mathematical concept which helps describing performance of an algorithm in terms of time and space relative to size of input_

1. Time Complexity
- Time complexity of an algorithm describes how runtime of the algorithm varies with the input size.
2. Space Complexity
- Space complexity of an algorithm describes how memory usage varies
